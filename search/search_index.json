AVERAGEIF A function that calculates the average of values in a range that meet a specific criterion. Cell Reference An identifier that points to a specific cell in a spreadsheet, typically expressed as a column letter followed by a row number (e.g., A1). Conditional Formatting A feature that changes the appearance of cells based on their values or other conditions, helping to highlight important data. COUNTIF A function that counts the number of cells in a range that meet a specific criterion. Data Validation A feature that restricts the type of data or values that users can enter into a cell, helping maintain data integrity. Formula An expression that calculates values based on the contents of cells or other data, typically beginning with an equals sign (=). Function A predefined formula that performs calculations using specific values in a particular order, such as SUMIF, AVERAGEIF, or COUNTIF. Linear Regression A statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the data. Multi-Level Sort A sorting method that uses multiple columns as sort criteria, applying secondary sorts when primary sort values are identical. R\u00b2 Value An indicator of how well data fits a statistical model. Also known as the coefficient of determination. Values range from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better fit. Range A group of adjacent cells in a spreadsheet, typically referenced by the top-left and bottom-right cells (e.g., A1:C5). Scatter Plot A type of chart that shows the relationship between two variables as points on a coordinate system. Often used for correlation analysis. Sort Range A command in Google Sheets that organizes data in ascending or descending order based on specified columns. SUMIF A function that adds values in a range that meet a specific criterion. Trendline A line added to a chart that represents the general direction or pattern of the data. Often used in regression analysis. Wildcard Special characters used in search criteria to represent unknown characters: asterisk (*) for any sequence of characters and question mark (?) for any single character. <p>Info</p> <p>This glossary covers the most common terms used in this guide.

Division by zero or an empty cell. Check your formula for division operations and ensure the denominator is never zero. Use the IFERROR function to handle this case: <code>=IFERROR(A1/B1, \"Cannot divide by zero\")</code>. Formula returns #VALUE! Using incorrect data types in a formula. Verify that the cells referenced in your formula contain the appropriate data types. For example, ensure you do not perform mathematical operations on text values. Formula returns #REF! Reference to a cell that no longer exists. Check if you have deleted rows or columns that were referenced in your formula. Restore the deleted data or update your formula to reference existing cells. Formula returns #NAME? Function name is misspelled. Double-check the spelling of function names. Functions returning unexpected results Mixed data types or hidden values affecting calculations. Check for inconsistent data types in your range. Look for hidden rows or filtered data that might be included in calculations. Verify that text values aren't being interpreted as zeros. Sorting not working as expected Hidden rows or merged cells in the data range. Unmerge any merged cells before sorting. Make sure to select the entire data range including headers. Check for hidden rows that might be excluded from the sort. Conditional formatting not applying Conflicting rules or incorrect formula. Check for multiple conditional formatting rules that might conflict. Review your custom formulas for errors. Try simplifying complex rules into multiple simpler rules. Data validation dropdown not showing Incorrect range reference or formatting issues. Verify the range used for validation exists and contains the expected values. Try recreating the data validation rule with a simpler range or explicit list of items. Formatting disappears after sorting Formatting applied to cells rather than data. Apply formatting to the data itself using conditional formatting rules based on cell values rather than manually formatting specific cells. Chart not updating with new data Chart data range is fixed. Edit the chart data range: click on the chart, select the three dots menu, choose Edit chart, and update the data range in the Chart editor. Linear regression trendline missing Insufficient data points or non-numeric data. Ensure your data contains at least two valid numeric data points. Check for any text or error values in your data series that might prevent the trendline from appearing. Cannot access sheet (Trying to connect...) Internet connection issues or Google service disruption. Check your internet connection. Verify Google Sheets service status at Google Workspace Status Dashboard. Try accessing the sheet in incognito mode to rule out browser extension issues. <p>Info</p> <p>For persistent issues not covered in this troubleshooting guide, visit the Google Sheets Help Center or use the Help menu in Google Sheets to search for specific error messages.</p>"}]}
